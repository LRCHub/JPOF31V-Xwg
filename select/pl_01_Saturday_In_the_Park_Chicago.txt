Saturday in the park
I think
it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think
it was the Fourth of July
People dancing people laughing
A man selling ice cream
singing Italian songs
Eicay varee' eisee' nardee'
Can you dig it Yes I can
And I've been waiting
such a long time
For Saturday
Another day in the park
I think
it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think
it was the Fourth of July
People talking really smiling
A man playing guitar
And singing for a song
Will you help him
change the world
Can you dig it Yes I can
And I've been waiting
such a long time
For today
Slow motion riders
fly the colors of the day
A bronze man still can
tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost
all is not lost oh no no
Forty days in the park
every day's the Fourth of July
Forty days in the park
every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching people touching
A real celebration
waiting for a song
Waiting for a song
If you want it really want it
Can you dig it Yes I can
I've been waiting
such a long time
For today yeah yeah yeah
